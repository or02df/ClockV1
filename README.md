# Clock Application

This project is a simplistic analogue clock application created for **BSc Computing students** at the **University of the Highlands and Islands (UHI)**, as part of the module **UG409765 - Software Construction**. It serves as the codebase for **Assessment 2** and is designed to provide hands-on experience with building and analysing a functional C# Windows Forms application.

## Overview

The Clock Application:

- Displays a ticking analogue clock on a Windows Form.
- Updates the clock in real-time using a timer.
- Draws the clock face, hour/minute marks, and clock hands dynamically.

The current implementation is written in a standard form. In an **upcoming tutorial**, we will refactor this application to follow the **Model-View-Presenter (MVP)** design pattern, emphasising separation of concerns and professional software design practices.

## Features

- **Real-Time Updates**: Synchronises with the system clock to ensure accurate time display.
- **Custom Drawing**: Uses the `Graphics` class to render the clock face and hands dynamically.
- **Timer-Based Logic**: Ensures smooth updates every second.

## Learning Outcomes

By working with this codebase, students will:

1. Understand how real-time applications are structured.
2. Explore the use of `Graphics` for custom rendering.
3. Learn the benefits of refactoring to design patterns like MVP.

For questions or support, please refer to the accompanying tutorials or discuss on the Discussion Board.
